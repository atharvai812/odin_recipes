        <li>1 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>

            2-3 whole green cardamom pods</li>
        <li>1 cinnamon stick (about 1 inch)</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Instructions:</b>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Eggs:</li>
        <p>Hard-boil the eggs, cool them, and then peel them. Cut each egg in half and set them aside.</p>
        <li>Make the Curry Base:</li>
        <p>Heat the vegetable oil in a large, deep pan or skillet over medium heat.
            Add the cumin seeds and let them splutter.
            Add the chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown. This may take about 8-10 minutes.</p>
        <li>Add the Aromatics: </li>
        <p>Add the minced garlic, ginger, and green chilies. Sauté for another 2-3 minutes until the raw aroma
            disappears.</p>
        <li>Add the Tomatoes:</li>
        <p>Add the finely chopped tomatoes and cook until they become soft and the oil starts to separate from the
            mixture.</p>
        <li>Spices:</li>
        <p>Add all the spices: coriander powder, turmeric powder, red chili powder, cumin powder, paprika (for color, if
            using), bay leaf, cloves, cardamom pods, and cinnamon stick. Stir well to combine.</p>
        <li>Yogurt:</li>
        <p>Reduce the heat to low and add the plain yogurt. Stir continuously to prevent curdling. Cook for a few
            minutes until the yogurt is well incorporated into the mixture.</p>
        <li>Water and Simmer:</li>
        <p>Add the water and bring the mixture to a simmer. Let it cook for about 5-7 minutes, or until the gravy
            thickens and the oil begins to float on top.</p>
        <li>Add the Eggs:</li>
        <p>Gently add the boiled egg halves to the curry. Simmer for another 5 minutes, allowing the eggs to soak up the
            flavors.</p>
        <li>Garnish and Serve:</li>
        <p>Remove the curry from heat, garnish with fresh coriander leaves, and sprinkle with garam masala.</p>
        <li>Feel free to adjust the spice levels to suit your taste. Anda Curry is a versatile dish, and you can make it
            milder or spicier as per your preference.</li>
    </ol>
