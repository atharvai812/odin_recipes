        <li>1-2 tablespoons of cooking oil (vegetable or canola oil)</li>
        <li>1 small onion, finely chopped (optional)</li>
        <li>1 small tomato, finely chopped (optional)</li>
        <li>1-2 green chilies, finely chopped (optional for spice)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of mixed vegetables (peas, carrots, and bell peppers work well)
            Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Water for cooking the noodles</li>
        <li>Chopped cilantro (coriander leaves) for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Boil the Noodles:</h3>
            <p>Boil enough water in a large pot to submerge the Maggi noodles.
                Once the water is boiling, add the noodles and cook them according to the instructions on the packet.
                Usually, it takes about 2-3 minutes.
                Stir occasionally to prevent sticking. Cook the noodles until they are soft but still slightly firm (al
                dente).
                Once done, drain the noodles in a colander and set them aside./p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Prepare the Tastemaker:</h3>
            <p>In a small bowl, empty the contents of the Maggi tastemaker sachet.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Cook the Maggi:</h3>
            <p>In a separate pan, heat 1-2 tablespoons of cooking oil over medium heat.
                If you're using onions, green chilies, and tomatoes, sauté them in the hot oil until the onions turn
                translucent and the tomatoes soften.
                Add the mixed vegetables and sauté them for a few more minutes until they are slightly tender.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Add the Noodles:</h3>
            <p>Now, add the boiled Maggi noodles to the pan with the sautéed vegetables.
                Stir everything together gently.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Season with Tastemaker:</h3>
            <p>Sprinkle the Maggi tastemaker over the noodles and vegetables.
                If you prefer less intense seasoning, you can use less of the tastemaker.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Mix and Cook:</h3>
            <p>Mix everything thoroughly so that the tastemaker is evenly distributed.
                Cook for another 2-3 minutes while stirring to allow the flavors to meld.
                Taste the Maggi and add salt if needed. Be cautious with the salt, as the tastemaker already contains
                salt.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Serve:</h3>
            <p>
                Once everything is well-mixed and heated through, remove the pan from heat.
                Garnish with chopped cilantro (coriander leaves) if desired.
                Serve hot and enjoy your homemade Maggi noodles!
