    <h2><b>Ingredients:</b></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 can (28 ounces) of whole tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 carrot, peeled and chopped</li>
        <li>1 celery stalk, chopped</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of sugar (optional, to balance the acidity of the tomatoes)</li>
        <li>2 cups of vegetable broth</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of dried basil</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of dried oregano</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of heavy cream (optional, for a creamy soup)</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves or parsley for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped onion, minced garlic, carrot, and celery. Saut√© for about 5-7 minutes, or until the
            vegetables are softened and the onion becomes translucent.</li>
        <li>If using whole canned tomatoes, break them up with a spoon or your hands and add them to the pot along with
            their juices. If you prefer a smoother soup, you can use crushed tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the sugar (if using), dried basil, and dried oregano. Cook for another 2-3 minutes to enhance the
            flavors.</li>
        <li>Pour in the vegetable broth and add the bay leaf. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low
            and let it simmer for about 15-20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.</li>
        <li>Remove the bay leaf, and if you have an immersion blender, carefully blend the soup directly in the pot
            until smooth. If you don't have an immersion blender, you can use a regular blender in batches, making sure
            to let the soup cool slightly before blending. Be cautious when blending hot liquids.</li>
        <li>Return the blended soup to the pot (if necessary) and warm it over low heat. If you prefer a creamy tomato
            soup, stir in the heavy cream at this point and let it heat through. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
        </li>
        <li>Once the soup is heated and seasoned to your liking, ladle it into bowls and garnish with fresh basil leaves
            or parsley, if desired.</li>
        <li>Serve your homemade tomato soup with crusty bread or croutons for a delightful meal.</li>
    </ol>
